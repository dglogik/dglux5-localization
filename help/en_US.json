For example, an offset of &minus;0.1 moves the columns to the left by 10% of this maximum width, and an offset of 0.1 moves the columns to the right by 10% of this maximum width. This property is related to the <strong>Column Width Ratio</strong> property for the chart. The <strong>Column Width Ratio</strong> determines the width of each column in the chart as a percentage of the maximum column width.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: The <strong>Column Width Ratio</strong> is 60%, and there are two series. To offset the columns in series 1 by 10% of their width, use the value (0.6 &#47; 2) * 0.1 &#61; 0.03 for <strong>Column Series Offset</strong>.</p>"
