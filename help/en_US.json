The JavaScript block uses meta to interact with the JavaScript of the page. meta can have two properties, element and gmap, both of which apply to the JavaScript block's parent object. In contrast, the Script block uses script in section Scripting and Syntax, including page model syntax such as @parent. Because of this, the JavaScript block is a better choice for accessing APIs and the Script block is a better choice for accessing the page model in script.<br/>•To access the code, the JavaScript block takes a path to a JavaScript file in the project, and the Script block takes script input as a multi-line text property.<br/>The JavaScript is loaded in the global namespace of the page and must meet the following requirements:<br/>•It must include a special init function, because the init function creates an instance of the script that is differentiated from any other instances that might be running on the page.<br/>•The special init function must return a function to be executed when the block is invoked.<br/>•The function returned by the init function must take meta, getValue, and setValue as parameters.<br/>If you make changes to the JavaScript code, these changes will take effect only if you refresh the browser—not simply if you close and reopen the .dg5 file.
